        <img class= "selfie" src="assets\images\image1.jpeg" alt="Chase Rabon">

        <p>I was born in Arlington, Texas but raised in Round Rock, and I love the Austin area. I previously worked at Blizzard Entertainment as a Technical Support Specialist for several years. After about four years I decided I needed a change and enlisted in the United States Air Force where I did Jet Engine work on the B-1 Lancer. When my time in the Air Force was up, I decided that I should pursue coding, and any oppurtunities that it might present me</p>
        
        <p>I am a Llama enthusiast and enjoy all things Llama, in truth it started as something of a joke in middle school that stuck. My friends and family all get me llama related presents anytime they come across them.</p>

        <p>Some of my hobbies include, playing Video Games, such as World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Destiny, Player Unknown's Battleground, Counter Strike, and Warframe. I also enjoy hiking, fishing, going to live music shows, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <p>I have always had a passion for technology, and I started making my own basic websites for video games all the way back in middle school. I truly hope to transition this passion into a career.</p>
